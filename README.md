Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis project on fraud detection in banking operations. The study focuses on the challenge of highly imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent cases represent only a small fraction of transactions. Using real-world credit card transaction data from the European Union, the project investigates resampling techniques and machine learning classifiers to improve fraud detection.

Objectives

Analyze the distribution of features between legitimate and suspicious transactions.

Apply resampling techniques (undersampling and oversampling) to handle class imbalance.

Evaluate three classification models:

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Random Forest Classifier

Balanced Random Forest Classifier

Run a total of 16 experiments combining different resampling and classifier configurations.

Assess model performance using metrics suitable for imbalanced data (e.g., recall, precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC).

Dataset

Source: Real-world anonymized credit card transaction data from the European Union.

Characteristics: Strong class imbalance â€” fraudulent cases represent less than 1% of the dataset.

Note: Due to data privacy and licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Methods

Resampling Techniques

Random undersampling

Random oversampling

Classifiers

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Random Forest

Balanced Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics

Recall (primary metric)

Precision

F1-score

ROC-AUC

Experiments

16 experiments were carried out by combining:

2 resampling strategies

3 classifiers

Different parameter settings

Results emphasize the importance of properly addressing class imbalance in fraud detection.

Results

Balanced Random Forest achieved the most stable performance across resampling setups.

MLP and Random Forest showed improvements under certain resampling strategies.

Recall was the most informative metric for assessing fraud detection effectiveness.
